# display-site-numbers - WordPress Plugin updated with new style
I installed the WordPress plugin called "display-site-numbers" (written by Fabio Marzocca) on my blog. This can be found on github here:<BR>

I created a new page called "Blog Stats" and used the plugin short code, which produced this default output:<BR>

I wanted the plugin to generate a different output so I edited the PHP code and added some new CSS. Here is what it now generates:<BR>

This can be seen live on my blog here:<BR>
